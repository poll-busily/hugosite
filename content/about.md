As a software and cybersecurity consultant working in Cambridge, I specialise in bridging the gap between security and engineering. My career in software spans from low-level firmware, right down at the hardware boundary, up to distributed cloud services, with a sprinkling of desktop and UI development in-between.

Working on writing is something I always mean to do more of so, on this site, I write about software, hardware and electronics but also my varied personal interests, such as photography (especially landscapes and wildlife), hiking, cycle touring, and amateur radio. If we're really getting into the weeds of niche interests then there are also posts on fountain pens and calligraphy, motorcycle restoration, and hi-fi headphones.
