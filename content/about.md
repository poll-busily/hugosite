Hello and thanks for dropping by 👋!

Professionally, I'm not a photographer at all, rather I'm a embedded software and cybersecurity consultant working in Cambridge. But more about that further down because this site is principallly my space for putting my photographic work out there.

## Professional Experience
My career is coming up on fifteen years now and in that time I've worked close to the hardware, far from the hardware and - for a time - ignoring the hardware and turning my hand to securing software instead. As a result, I would call myself a *multidisciplinary engineer* above all else. While my background is in computer science, I can happily cross over into electronics and even mechanical design when a project calls for it.

If that sounds like a useful skill set then we should talk! See below 👇 for contact methods.

## Galleries and Posts
Working on writing is something I always mean to do more of so, on this site, I write about software, hardware and electronics but also my varied personal interests, such as photography (especially landscapes and wildlife), hiking, cycle touring, and amateur radio. If we're really getting into the weeds of niche interests then there are also posts on fountain pens and calligraphy, motorcycle restoration, and hi-fi headphones.

## Get in Touch
Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn for professional networking, or through Instagram for ~~unprofessional~~ informal networking.

## AI Content
A few short years ago I wouldn't have needed to say anything on the matter but strange times are ahead for creators. So here it is: none of the content on the site has been created using AI, either wholly or with the use of AI assistance. My view is that it can be a fine tool for work but that - at the very least - our voices, imperfect as they may be, must remain our own.

Thanks for reading and have a fine day!
