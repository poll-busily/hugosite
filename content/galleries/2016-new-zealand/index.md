An overdue return to photography.

The frigid, rushing waters of this river - high up in the hills towards John Tait hut in the Nelson Lakes National Park - would lead you to believe that the day was cool and water was plentiful when, in actuality, New Zealand was experiencing a scorching hot summer and temperatures were well above 30c this day.

And here you see my destination and stop for the night: Upper Travers Hut, nestled between mountains and looking out across a wide patch of open grassland that separates two segments of climbing; a welcome rest stop before continuing up and then *over* the next peaks and beginning the hike back to the lower lakes.

Of course, what they don't include on the tourist brochures is that this is, in fact, the *second* Upper Travers Hut, having been built in 2004 after avalanche damage did the first one in. I would have slept worse had it not been the height of the summer months!
