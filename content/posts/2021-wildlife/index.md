In 2021, I rented the [Sony 200-600 f/5.6-6.3 G](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/camera-lenses/sel200600g) lens from the always-excellent [Lenses for Hire](https://lensesforhire.co.uk) (no affiliation, just a happy customer), taking it to the Lake District for a week of walking and wildlife spotting around Borrowdale. The try-before-you-buy approach has saved me quite a bit of money in the past, having rented the Sony 16-35 f/2.8 GM, 24-70 f/2.8 GM and 28-70 f/2 GM and gone on to purchase *none* of them. With the 200-600 though, I was immediately impressed by its reach and, surprisingly, its utility for general landscape photography, too: a rocky forest outcrop at 500mm, or some tree branches around 300mm, for example.
