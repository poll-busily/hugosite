## Classic and Lush

While it's undoubtedly true that this lens isn't as precisely corrected as its 21, 25 and 50mm stablemates - f2 and f2.2 especially show some noticeable chromatic abberations - the
35mm Loxia is no slouch when stopped down. Just look at that colour rendering on this otherwise grey and overcast day, and the precise subject separation between the top of the gate and the background.

While I maintain that I plan to be buried with my Loxia 50mm, I don't think the 35mm would be far behind!
