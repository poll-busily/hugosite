The Zeiss Loxia 35mm f/2.0 is part of Zeiss' (now discontinued) line of manual focus lenses for Sony E-mount, launched in late 2014 and closely following the announcement of the E mount itself and the first generation of A7 cameras. Let's see how well this lens hold up a decade later when paired with a 61MP sensor that has nearly twice the pixel count of the cameras it launched alongside.

## On Paper: Specifications
All Loxia lenses share some family traits:
- Manual focus, naturally
- Reasonably fast wide open apertures (>= f/2.4)
- Fully metal exterior construction
- Electronic contacts for registration with the camera body

## What Do I Like About the Loxia 35?
Stopped down for traditional landscape use, the 35mm Loxia is no slouch and delivers a high contrast image with great sharpness across the frame. The image below of a cluster of pine trees in the Scottish coastal village of Torridon was shot at f/11 using a tripod and the rendering is as crisp and colourful as any lens I own.

Speaking of rendering, this lens is great at pulling colour out of a grey and overcast day; I especially enjoy the full greens of this garden scene, even though the weather was dismal. See also the precise subject separation between the top of the gate and the background, demonstrating pleasing bokeh even stopped down slightly to f/4.5.

## What I Don't Love
By modern standards, the performance of this lens wide-open at f/2 is quite poor. Centre sharpness is good but falls off somewhat towards the corners of the image.
